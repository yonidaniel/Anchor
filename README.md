It can be assumed that the values ​​you receive are valid values

Values ​​entered as "double" are converted to "float" - this has been done for convince (pyhon have float not double)

In database file there are 2 lines of code that you need to uncomment for the first time (you can comment it after the first run)

Make sure you have all the import install:
sqlalchemy
sqlalchemy.orm
unittest
typing
fastapi
flask_sqlalchemy.session
json
pydantic

You can't lookup from one spreadsheet to another

In the Debug configuration, in the Scripts parameter I had this for debuging:
"app:app --reload"

Also I startet the app via terminal like this:
"uvicorn main:app --reload"

I didnt had time to do integration test (Im in Thailand :) )
Hope you will find its working for you

If you have any question, please send a message or call :)

Thanks
